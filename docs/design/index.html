<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document explains the design choices of Hexya, including the reason why we decided to write
Hexya in the first place.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We used Odoo (<a href="http://www.odoo.com">http://www.odoo.com</a>) for a few years to fulfil our customers need of business
applications. We are great fans of Odoo and managed to create applications for very different
businesses, from a 2 people service company to a 500 industrial company.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, if Odoo is perfectly fitted for small and medium businesses it does not scale well
for bigger companies. When we say this, we don&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t have thousands of users
on odoo servers, Odoo&#8217;s SaaS platform proves the contrary. We say that Odoo does not scale for
bigger companies because these companies need more business logic and calculations (such as
schedulers, reporting, etc.) and on much larger sets of data. With a 500 people company, we
feel we have reached the maximum of calculation power that Odoo could deliver.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So we decided to write Hexya to address this issue, with the following in mind:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>We want to keep the best from Odoo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We want speed for the complex business logic calculation of medium and intermediate
businesses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_odoo_features">2. Odoo features</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we want to keep the best from Odoo, we need to define what are, in our opinion, the great
features of this software.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_modular_design">2.1. Modular design</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We believe that the success of Odoo among its partners and the opensource community is mainly
due to its full modular architecture. From the user point of view, this is interesting since
it allows to enable/disable features just by installing or uninstalling modules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But it is, in our opinion, really from the developer point of view that this makes a
difference. Indeed, the theory of opensource is that you can modify a software to fit your
need. This is great, but doing so you actually create a fork and do not benefit automatically
from upstream updates. So in general very few people actually do it. The genius of Odoo&#8217;s
modular architecture is that you don&#8217;t need to make a fork to make a modification to the
application: you just have to create a module, and this module can modify any element of the
main application (models, views, controllers, client, …) without touching a single line of
the original code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is definitely something we want to have in Hexya: <strong>one should be able to customize Hexya by
creating a module without changing Hexya code.</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_large_business_code_base">2.2. Large business code base</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over the years, Odoo&#8217;s business code (i.e. business logic in add-ons) has grown so much that
it can handle business situations from sales to human resources through mrp and event
management. This large number of business applications and associated code is also part of
the success of Odoo.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This code base is so developed that it would take years rewriting it from scratch. Although
Hexya will not be written in python and its internals will be completely different from that
of Odoo, <strong>Hexya will keep Odoo&#8217;s business data model</strong> so that modules can be easily ported
from Odoo to Hexya.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_design_choices">3. Design choices</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section highlights design choices for Hexya that are different from that of Odoo. They
are all made in order to achieve a good speed in business logic calculation.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_go_instead_of_python">3.1. Go instead of Python</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>High calculation speed means a compiled language. Of course there are several workarounds
to speed up interpreted languages, but we&#8217;re better of with the right tool at the
beginning rather than trying to make fixes all the time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Hexya will be written in GO</strong> which is a compiled language known for its fast compilation
and execution, that is easy to learn and has some reflection capacities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_static_configuration">3.2. Static configuration</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of Odoo&#8217;s feature is that all the configuration of the software is dynamic and held in
the database, such as installed modules, view definitions, etc. This is particularly
interesting for Odoo in a SaaS environment where several customers use the same Odoo instance
and each have its own database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The drawback of this feature is that the database is constantly queried to get data that
hardly change over time. Due to its modular architecture, Odoo also needs to recompute the
elements (such as views) at each request by adding data from all the modules that impact this
element before sending it to the client. Here again, the data is the same at each request and
the calculation gives the same result each time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Hexya configuration data will be computed at compile time</strong>. Only business configuration will
be dynamic and stored into the database. This means that a recompilation will be necessary
each time an element (view, model, controller) will be modified, but with go&#8217;s quick
compilation this will not be a big issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This choice has several implications that should not be an issue for the target businesses:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Installed modules will be determined at compile time, there is no one click install.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A running Hexya instance will have all its database with the same configuration, so SaaS Hexya
will not be possible as it is in Odoo. Different configurations will mean different instances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_developer_friendly_for_high_code_quality">3.3. Developer friendly for high code quality</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We believe that ERP systems are serious and need high code quality. We also believe that high
code quality is achieved, among others, by static types, attributes and methods that allow
many errors to be lifted at compile time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Hexya&#8217;s business development API will be fully static</strong>. This also allows common IDEs to make
reliable inspections and auto-completion. Developers won&#8217;t have to lookup manually existing
fields or methods in a model, they will autocomplete nicely.</p>
