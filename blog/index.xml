      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since we released our first technology preview back in January. But actually, behind the scene, a lot of work has been done since then.
By playing with the new demo, you will certainly notice the new UI theme and a few improvements here and there. But the main part of the work has been on the core of Hexya, which, sadly, cannot be seen on the demo itself.</description>

      <description>Our first technology preview of Hexya is online at https://demo.hexya.io after almost two years of work.
It is a quick port of Odoo&amp;rsquo;s sale module with its main dependencies on Hexya&amp;rsquo;s framework. The purpose of this preview is to show how several independent modules interact to build the whole application. So do not expect business features to work seamlessly. In particular, the accounting module has only been scaffolded with all its models, views and menus, but none of the functions have been implemented.</description>

      <title>Why we chose Go for Hexya</title>

      <description>Origin of Hexya As explained in our design doc, Hexya is a rewrite of Odoo. At the beginning of 2016, a guy who participate in a personnal project written in Python asked me if I ever heard about Go. I didn&amp;rsquo;t, so I went to Go&amp;rsquo;s website and read &amp;ldquo;Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Hexya! Hexya&amp;rsquo;s development started in February 2016 with the idea to create a business application develpment framework that would have the same unique modularity concept as Odoo, but would also:
 Be much faster and allow for heavier business computation loads Provide developer friendly API, in particular the ability to have autocompletion  Today, we have implemented almost all targeted features of the framework, including the unique models, views and controllers iterative declaration principle.</description>
